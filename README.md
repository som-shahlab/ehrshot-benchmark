# 

Unlike prior EHR benchmarks limited to the ICU setting, **EHRSHOT** contains the **full longitudinal health records of 6,739 patients from Stanford Medicine** and a diverse set of **15 classification tasks** tailored towards few-shot evaluation of pre-trained models. 

> [!NOTE]  
> EHRSHOT is now available as a [üíä MEDS compatible dataset](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard).
> 
> Please visit this [**Redivis link**](https://redivis.com/datasets/53gc-8rhx41kgt) and download the file called `EHRSHOT_MEDS.zip`

# üöÄ Quick Start

Use the following steps to run the EHRSHOT benchmark.

**1)**: Install **EHRSHOT**

```bash
conda create -n EHRSHOT_ENV python=3.10 -y
conda activate EHRSHOT_ENV

git clone https://github.com/som-shahlab/ehrshot-benchmark.git
cd ehrshot-benchmark
pip install -e .
```

**2)**: Install **FEMR**

For our data preprocessing pipeline we use **[FEMR  (Framework for Electronic Medical Records)](https://github.com/som-shahlab/femr)**, a Python package for building deep learning models with EHR data. 

You must also have CUDA/cuDNN installed (we recommend CUDA 11.8 and cuDNN 8.7.0). 

> [!CAUTION]
> This currently only works on Linux machines.

```bash
pip install femr-cuda==0.1.16 dm-haiku==0.0.9 optax==0.1.4
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda]==0.4.8" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

**3)**: **Download dataset + model** from [Redivis here](https://redivis.com/datasets/53gc-8rhx41kgt) and place the results in a directory called `EHRSHOT_ASSETS/`.

**4)**: **Run** the benchmark end-to-end with:

```bash
bash run_all.sh
```

# üîÆ Foundation Model for EHRs

**Access:** [The model is on HuggingFace here](https://huggingface.co/StanfordShahLab/clmbr-t-base) and requires signing a research usage agreement.

We publish the model weights of a **141 million parameter** clinical foundation model pre-trained on the deidentified structured EHR data of **2.57M patients** from Stanford Medicine.

We are [one of the first](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12961) to fully release such a model for coded EHR data; in contrast, most prior models released for clinical data  (e.g. GatorTron, ClinicalBERT) only work with unstructured text and cannot process the rich, structured data within an EHR.

We use [Clinical Language-Model-Based Representations (CLMBR)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046420302653) as our model. CLMBR is an autoregressive model designed to predict the next medical code in a patient's timeline given previous codes. CLMBR employs causally masked local attention, ensuring forward-only flow of information which is vital for prediction tasks and is in contrast to BERT-based models which are bidirectional in nature. We utilize a transformer as our base model with 141 million trainable parameters and a next code prediction objective, providing minute-level EHR resolution rather than the day-level aggregation of the original model formulation.

# üóÉÔ∏è Dataset + Tasks

**Access:** We provide three versions of EHRSHOT. Access requires signing a research usage agreement.

1. **Original:** [Link](https://redivis.com/datasets/53gc-8rhx41kgt). The original EHRSHOT dataset from the paper (and version compatible with this repo) is stored in `EHRSHOT_ASSETS.zip`. The rest of this documentation refers to the **Original** dataset.
2. **MEDS:** [Link](https://redivis.com/datasets/53gc-8rhx41kgt). The EHRSHOT dataset in a [MEDS](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard) compatible version is stored in `EHRSHOT_MEDS.zip`. It contains the **same exact data** as **Original**.
3. **OMOP:** [Link](https://redivis.com/datasets/53gc-8rhx41kgt). All of the EHRSHOT patients, but with their full OMOP table dumps. This contains the same patients as **Original**, but **different data** (i.e. full OMOP tables).

EHRSHOT contains:
* **6,739 patients**
* **41.6 million clinical events**
* **921,499 visits**
* **15 prediction tasks**

Each patient consists of an ordered timeline of clinical events taken from the structured data of their EHR (e.g. diagnoses, procedures, prescriptions, etc.). 

### Tasks

Each task is a predictive classification task, and includes a canonical train/val/test split. The tasks are defined as follows:

|         Task         | Type              | Prediction Time                       | Time Horizon           | Possible Label Values in Dataset |

# üìä Comparison to Prior Work

Most prior benchmarks are (1) limited to the ICU setting and (2) not tailored towards few-shot evaluation of pre-trained models.

In contrast, **EHRSHOT** contains (1) the full breadth of longitudinal data that a health system would expect to have on the patients it treats and (2) a broad range of tasks designed to evaluate models' task adaptation and few-shot capabilities:

## Downloading the Athena Ontology

The FEMR extract provided in the Redivis download contains all the necessary concepts, so you can ignore this so long as you skip running the bash script `1_create_femr_database.sh`.

If you want to recreate the FEMR extract from scratch, however, then you'll need to download the Athena ontology yourself:
1. Go to the [Athena website at this link](https://athena.ohdsi.org/vocabulary/list). You may need to create an account.
2. Click the green "Download" button at the top right of the website
3. Click the purple "Download Vocabularies" button below the green "Download" button
4. Name the bundle "athena_download" and select 5.x version
5. Scroll to the bottom of the list, and click the blue "Download" button
6. It will take some time for the download to be ready. Please [refresh the webpage here](https://athena.ohdsi.org/vocabulary/download-history) to check whether your download is ready. Once the download is ready, click "Download"
7. After the download is complete, unzip the file and move all the files into the `EHRSHOT_ASSETS/athena_download/` folder in your repo.

After downloading the Athena OHDSI Ontology, you will have to separately download the CPT subset of the ontology. You can follow the instructions in the `readme.txt` in your Athena download, or follow the steps below:

1. Create a [UMLS account here](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/signup-login)
2. Get your [UMLS API key here](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/edit-profile)
3. From the `EHRSHOT_ASSETS/athena_download/` folder, run this command: `bash cpt.sh <YOUR UMLS API KEY>`

Your ontology will then be ready to go!

## Scripts

We've included a number of helper scripts in `ehrshot/scripts`. None of these are needed to run the EHRSHOT benchmark, but they provide useful functionality as follows:

* [confirm_labeled_patients_are_equal](ehrshot/scripts/confirm_labeled_patients_are_equal.py) - confirms that two `EHRSHOT_ASSETS/benchmark/` folders contain identical labels in their `labeled_patients.csv` files
* [convert_clmbr_dictionary_to_json](ehrshot/scripts/convert_clmbr_dictionary_to_json.py) - converts the [CLMBR vocabulary file](/EHRSHOT_ASSETS/models/clmbr/dictionary) into a human readable `.json` file.
* [convert_to_meds](ehrshot/scripts/convert_to_meds.py) - converts EHRSHOT into the [MEDS dataset format](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/meds/tree/main)
* [create_splits](ehrshot/scripts/create_splits.py) - creates splits for other FEMR extracts into the EHRSHOT format
* [generate_benchmark_starr](ehrshot/scripts/generate_benchmark_starr.py) - runs EHRSHOT labelers on entire Stanford STARR-OMOP dataset

## Context Clues

The files in `ehrshot/context_clues` contain scripts used for evals in the [Context Clues paper](https://github.com/som-shahlab/hf_ehr/tree/main).
